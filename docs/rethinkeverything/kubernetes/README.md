## Installing k8s on incus
It turns out I cant install vms on my home servers because they do not have sufficient resources.
So we are installing our test cluster (for the Certified Kubernetes Administrator test) at the colo 
The course work is based on ubuntu 24.04 but we use RockyLinux at work so my original intention was to build a R9 cluster at home and Ubuntu/focal at work. However the instruction is so specific to the platform I am going to start on Ubuntu at the colo and at work and then rebuild the cluster using R9 on the cluster.
