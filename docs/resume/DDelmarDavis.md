## Summary
*(I'll be 78 when Unix(tm) time ends)....*

I have been administering Unix systems for more than 30 years, in addition to deploying and maintaining Web and other Internet services for 25. The systems have ranged from stand-alone, completely exposed servers to services with separate Web, application, and database layers, clustered and load balanced for redundancy and scalability, and placed behind firewalls, I have done work in the ever amorphous cloud infrastructure provided by Amazon but I am more interested in locally owned and operated LXD based containers.

I have extensive experience with Linux deployments (Red Hat/Fedora/Centos, SUSE, Debian/Ubuntu, Tizen, OpenWRT) I have professional experience with HP-UX, True64, Linux, Solaris, Freebsd, OS X, and AIX and I have installed and configured databases such as Oracle, Sybase, and SQL Server. Against my better judgment, I have installed, maintained and configured Microsoft systems, and even made them play well with others
(SSO, SMB, etc). Additionally, I have a strong background and proven success in providing instruction and documentation for work to be maintained by others.

Throughout my career I have learned new systems quickly. I follow issues and problems through to solution, be they social or technical. Security is the key to surviving on both the World Wide Web and large Intranets. For this reason, I am a practitioner and proponent and of well defined policies, best practices, regular updates, and common sense. My reputation for getting things done and team participation make me an ideal candidate for positions where honest work is valued.
Specialties: Thinking outside the box. 

Also: Springfield and Waltham are not Boston in the same way Hillsboro and Beaverton are not Portand and I am not interested in your urgent requirement for Intel's permanently contingent workforce at Jones Farm so don't bother asking....

## Experience

###Systems Engineer
**Laika** Jul 2021 - Present.

### Contiguous Online Server Presence
**Fromhell.com** Nov 1996 - Present *(28 years 2 months +)*

I have built and maintained servers for the domains digithink.com and fromhell.com (email only) since 1996. They started as a sparc IPC running SunOs 4.1.3 and have had many different varients of bsd and linux since then. They are currently on incus containers running Debian. My current toolset includes ansible, python and zfs. I also document my work even when it's just mine. (See:[https://www.digithink.com](https://www.digithink.com))

### Package Handler

**UPS** Oct 2017 - Jul 2021 *(3 years 9 months)*

Its funny, If I went to the gym I would never build the muscles I have from sorting ~6000 packages a day for close to 4 years. I had a 12 minute bicycle commute. Another 10 minutes to get to the other side of the channel to PCCs campus in the shipyards (Before covid, UPS  reimbursed my tuition as I updated my welding skills). I got to see first hand the advantages that unionized workers have over similar non union positions (looking at you Amazon). Through the teamsters I recieved better health insurance than I ever received doing tech work. Also nice to not have a digital leash (going on 3 years cell phone free).
Life is good.

### Applications Engineer

For roughly a decade I worked through Tempus Dictum (DBA Suspect Devices) building hardware and software solutions around the Arduino and other open source hardware and software. My primary focus was on tools for artists and musicians. Client projects ranged from medical equipment, to bicycle racing, to music, to heavy industrial motor controllers. In addition to my embedded work I coded applications for Macintosh and iPhone. I developed hardware platform for teaching micro-controllers to artists and hobbyists. I produced and continue to present workshops focused on introducing micro-controllers to the community. As a systems administrator I maintained multiple internet servers for this company and clients. Upgraded and maintaining a linux based scientific computing cluster at UCSF. Test-deployed cluster implementation to the Amazon Elastic Cloud to benchmark cloud against old hardware. Recent client work involved moving a legacy FreeBSD System to the cloud and exploring cloud based archival options.

Supported the build servers and developers tools for the tizen platform as prescribed by Intel ( OpenSuse 12.1-12.3). Later I was hired. I migrated servers to new Open Source Technology Center in the Pearl and argued successfully to move to Debian as primary linux platform. I was unsuccessful in convincing management that the position should be outsourced.. Supported 56 servers running Debian and OpenSUSE in addition to roughly the same number of Windows 7 based systems and users.

To be fair it took well over a month before I got the call, gave my notice, and went back to welding. I stood and welded out catch basins (GMAW and OXY/Acetylene work) until I realized how short I was financially. I asked for $1.75 <!-- $ --> more an hour at a shop that hadn't raised any of its employees wages in close to a year. They raised the entire shop floor by 50c and offered me a 75c raise.
