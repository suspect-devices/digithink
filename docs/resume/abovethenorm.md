Name: Delmar Davis

Role: Systems Engineer

“Delmar takes on big, complicated projects that require developing new skills along the way, and he always delivers. This is a testament to his decades of experience in this field! An example of this pattern is his commitment to deploying the VMware environment in order to retire the legacy KVM hosts. Delmar dove in headfirst and was able to wrap up the entire project by the end of the year. That gave us the ability to start 2025 on the right foot in terms of environment and virtualization platform. Our ability to work using those virtual machines is invisible to us due to the large effort that Delmar did behind the scenes.

Delmar always puts himself forward to take on these big projects rather than being nominated to do them, and this is due to his can-do attitude and dedication to pushing things forward. I absolutely love seeing Delmar in action, and I know that the team and I can blindly rely on his dedication, expertise, and intelligence to get the job done.
Delmar often posts links to songs in the Core Mattermost channel, often by old punk bands none of us have ever heard of, when the song matches the sentiment of what we're discussing. We find it funny yet engaging in a very strange way that gets us all connected on a different level. Delmar is just truly genuine and amazing.”
