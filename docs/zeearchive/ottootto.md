# otto (OTTO) a ubuntu laptop/server.



Recently I built out a ubuntu laptop to work on these rariton PDUs we have a bunch of at work. So I had the install media handy when I locked myself out of Shirleys retired (thanks again apple) laptop which was running octoprint. The usb network adapter had been on one of a pile of rpi-zeros with odd names like ottootto. Since the original ocotprint server was named something else I was trying to figure out how the heck I had a persistan system with that name. On the other hand I love that song.
