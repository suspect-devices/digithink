# HP Z400 notes

### What to do when you get a desktop version of ubuntu and you want a server

```sh
sudo bash
apt-get update&&apt-get dist-upgrade && apt-get autoremove
nano /etc/hostname 


root@joey:~# cd /etc/netplan/
root@joey:~# mv 01-network-manager-all.yaml /tmp/
root@joey:~# nano 50-cloud-init.yaml
network:
	version: 2
	renderer: networkd
	ethernets:
	enp1s0:
		dhcp4: no
		dhcp6: no
	bridges:
	br0:
		dhcp4: no
		dhcp6: no
		addresses:
			- 192.168.0.65/24
		gateway4: 192.168.0.1
		nameservers:
			addresses:
				- 192.168.0.1
				- 198.202.31.141
		interfaces:
			- enp1s0

root@joey:~# netplan apply
root@joey:~# reboot


root@joey:~# apt-get install openssh-server


root@joey:~# nano /etc/default/grub
root@joey:~# update-grub
root@joey:~# systemctl enable multi-user.target --force
root@joey:~# systemctl set-default multi-user.target 
root@joey:~# reboot
```	
## Memory
Looking at the memory usage for that standalone desktop it seems like we could get by with 4G until we decide to use zfs or containers. Our file server is running 3 containers and 7T of zfs and uses 12.8G.(out of 21)

The cheapest memory I could find at present is on eBay at $4/G

### On Board "Fake" Raid
The bios raid on the hpz400 is a bastardized spitwad created by intel hp and only seems to play well with micro$oft. The drivers which kind of worked under dmraid have been integrated into linux's mdraid drivers. The newfangled installer on 18.04 server (subiquity) breaks on it. The alternative installer installs an os on the raid array but it won't boot. You can boot it from another disk but it won't boot by itself. 

#### Making it work
Since I purchased a 240G ssd for this server I installed ubuntu manually to a 10G partition on it, When installing the os activate the intel raid but not the sata raid. Rebooting the box gives you the option of booting to the bios raid array. From there you can chroot onto the boot disk and update the grub default to boot the other disk.

	
```sh
root@joey:~# mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt
root@joey:~# mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
root@joey:~# mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/sys
root@joey:~# mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
root@joey:~# chroot /mnt
root@joey:/# cd etc
root@joey:/etc# nano default/grub
...
GRUB_DEFAULT=2
root@joey:/etc# update-grub
```

'' Note: There may be a bios upgrade to fix this however z400 will not boot from SmartArray P810 either.

### Upgrading the Processor
According to [this thread](https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Business-PCs-Workstations-and-Point-of-Sale-Systems/HP-Z400-CPU-upgrade/td-p/5048908) the z400 with the 6 memory slots will support the Xeon 56xx family.

I purchased one on eBay for 10 bucks. I probably should have purchased 2
